#### Here are the list of todos **(Open an issue if you want to contribute!)**:

- [ ] Create a conda package
- [ ] Generate a high resolution map by assembling tiles, similar to [label-maker](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker).

- [ ] Probably make a documentation website similar to 
  - [ ] [GPy](https://gpy.readthedocs.io) or 
  - [ ] [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) or 
  - [ ] [AX](https://ax.dev/) 

Though first template is preferable. 

- [ ] Get roads route in json format from specified latitude longitudes.

- [ ] Get all the local stores and shops in a certain radius of a coordinate.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

* Probably create a separate module for all these stuffs

* Also create a separate branch like **feature-name** for each feature, and then after all the tests
 and stuffs, merge them to master branch. 
 
* Maintain the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Jimut123/jimutmap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in a detailed way from now onwards (Only add significant changes after deploying to master)

* After a feature is deployed to master, [x] it here.

* Master should always contain production-ready code for deployment to pip and conda
