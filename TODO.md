Here are the list of todos **(Open an issue if you want to contribute!)**:

* Create a conda package

* Generate a high resolution map by assembling tiles, similar to [label-maker](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker).

* Probably make a documentation website similar to 
  * [GPy](https://gpy.readthedocs.io) or 
  * [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) or 
  * [AX](https://ax.dev/) 

Though first template is preferable. 

* Get roads route in json format from specified latitude longitudes.

* Get all the local stores and shops in a certain radius of a coordinate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Probably create a separate module for all these stuffs]

[Also create a separate branch like **feature-name** for each feature, and then after all the tests
 and stuffs, merge them to master branch]


Note:
Master should always contain production-ready code for deployment to pip and conda
