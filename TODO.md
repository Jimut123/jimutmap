* Create a conda package

* Generate a high resolution map by assembling tiles, similar to [label-maker](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker).

* Probably make a documentation website similar to 
  * [GPy](https://gpy.readthedocs.io) or 
  * [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) or 
  * [AX](https://ax.dev/) 

Though first template is preferable.
